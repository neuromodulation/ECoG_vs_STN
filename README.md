The data is converted into BIDS format https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-019-0105-7. It is setup out of 16 subjects with ECoG and simultaneous STN-LFP recordings. The patients  were undergoing DBS surgery for treatment of Parkinson's Disease.  

The Feature Estimation was done code that is now available in the py_neuromodulation toolbox: https://github.com/neuromodulation/py_neuromodulation
